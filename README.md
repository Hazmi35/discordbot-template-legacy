# discordbot-template (LEGACY)

> This is an old version of [Hazmi35/discordbot-template](https://github.com/Hazmi35/discordbot-template) that's used in [Hazmi35/jukebox](https://github.com/Hazmi35/jukebox) (slimmed down version without category support)

### Note about Node version 12.x
This template supports 12.x but with not default configuration, to support node 12.x please modify the target in tsconfig.json to ES2019

### Will I Update this template?
Yes, because I still use this template on some bots and [Hazmi35/discordbot-template](https://github.com/Hazmi35/discordbot-template) is not finished *yet.* so of course I'll update this template.
